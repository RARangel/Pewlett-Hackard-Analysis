## Summary

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
    There are over 72,000 employees who are reaching retirement age.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
    There are over 1500 employees who are elilble for mentorship.  There does not seem to be enough elibible employees, so there will need to be
    a considerable amount of hiring to offset the silver tsunami.

Two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
The company can look at the salaries table to see how much could be saved from retiring employees and hiring younger, entry level staff.  Also 
the salaries table would give insight into which positions can be sought after in the job market/ recruitment drives.
